# React app for book search via Google Books
In this app I used Goggle Books API to make a SPA for book search. It shows the user the results of the search in the form of several cards with images. The cards have general information about the books, its authors, etc. They also have 'like' and 'delete' buttons, which like and delete cards accordingly. I also added a filter to sort books, so that it will show liked books seperately.
